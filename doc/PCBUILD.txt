This file contains instructions for building the Wizzer Works Toolroot
installation packages.

Dependencies

1. Perl must first be installed. ActivePerl can be installed from
   <workarea>/pc/devtools/ActivePerl-5.6.1.633-MSWin32-x86.msi.

Note: <workarea> is where the toolroot has been checked-out to. For example,
<workarea> might be E:\Auteur\toolroot.

Instructions

1. Open a bash shell window. Bash can be found in the <workarea>\pc\bin
   directory.

2. Update the PATH environment variable to include the Perl bin directory
   as well as the two PC bin directories. For example:

SET PATH=.;E:\Auteur\toolroot\pc\bin;E:\Auteur\toolroot\pc\bin2;C:\Perl\bin

3. Change the working directory to <workarea>\pc\build.

4. run "make"

5. This will build six Installshield packages:

wz_toolroot_Install.exe           Installs everthing except the extra tools
                                  and the InstallShield tools.
wz_toolroot_base_Install.exe      Installs the base toolroot.
wz_toolroot_doc_Install.exe       Installs the toolroot documentation.
wz_toolroot_examples_Install.exe  Installs the toolroot examples.
wz_toolroot_extras_Install.exe    Installs the extra tools.
wz_toolroot_is5_Install.exe       Installs the InstallShiled tools.

6. To clean-up the environment, run "make clobber"

Note: A batch script is made available under <workarea>\pc\cmd to help
set-up this environment. It is called wztools.bat. Modify it to reflect
your environment.
