<DT><B>DESCRIPTION</B>
<DD><A HREF="ibCollect.pl.html">ibCollect.pl</A> appends entries to a collection database for later
use by <A HREF="ibBuild.pl.html">ibBuild.pl</A>.  A collection database entry for a file
includes:
<UL>
	<LI> the path of the file to be installed (the source path)
	<LI> the path it should be installed as,
	<LI> and any <A HREF="ibBuild.pl.html">ibBuild.pl</A> "tags" it should have.
</UL>

<BR>

<B>-destDir destinationDirectory</B><BR>The destination directory is a relative path from the top directory
into which the installation image is installed.  This must be specified.<P><B>-tags "tagName ..."</B><BR>Every file should be tagged with one or more installation tags.  These
tags are used to decide which subsystem of your products contains the
file.  (This is similar to idb tags on the SGI.)  These must be specified.<P><B>-baseDir baseDirectory</B><BR>To avoid having absolute pathnames in the collection file.  The source
path is recorded as a relative path from a directory known as the
<I>base directory</I> (corresponding to <I>install</I>'s SRC directory
on the SGI). The base directory can be provided with the <B>-baseDir</B>
option.  If this option is not used, <A HREF="ibCollect.pl.html">ibCollect.pl</A> tries to get
its value from the environment variable $IBBASEDIR.  The base
directory must be specified one of these two ways.<P><B>-srcDir sourceDirectory</B><BR>Relative source filenames are treated as being relative to
sourceDirectory.  sourceDirectory defaults to the current working
directory.<P><B>-dest destinationFileName</B><BR>Normally, files are installed with the same name as they have in your
file system.  If you want to install them under a different name,
use the -dest flag to set that name.  Note that you must specify only
one file to use if you use this flag.<P><B>-q</B><BR>Runs silently.<P>
