<p></p>

<dd><b>InstallBuilder</b> -- system for building installable images
on the PC and/or Linux</dd>

<p></p>

<dt><b>DESCRIPTION</b></dt>

<p></p>

<dd>InstallBuilder is a system for automatically creating
self-extracting installers for the Windows and Linux platforms. It consists of
several executables and a process for using them. It is a very
simplified version of SGI's system for making "inst" images. In
this document, we will point out the rough correspondances between
parts of InstallBuilder and parts of SGI's "inst"-making process.

<p>The system consists of the following parts:</p>

<ul>
      <li><a href="ibCollect.html">ibCollect.pl</a> records which files should be installed 
        and where. It corresponds to install's use during "make rawidb" on the 
        SGI.</li>

      <li><a href="ibVerifyCollection.html">ibVerifyCollection.pl</a> compares a collection 
        of files to be installed against a master list. It generates "missing" 
        and "extra" files to record any differences. This corresponds to "idbjoin" 
        on the SGI.</li>

      <li><a href="ibBuild.html">ibBuild.pl</a> generates an distribution package for 
        each product listed in the product specification ("spec") file.<br>
<br>
On the PC this distribution package is an executable.
When run, this executable will extract from itself
and run an InstallShield installer for that product.<br>
<br>
On a Linux platform this distribution package is an RPM file.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<p></p>

<dt><b>USUAL PROCESS</b></dt>

<p></p>

<dd>Following the
<a href="makefileStyleGuide.html">Makefile Style Guidelines</a>
for the cross-platform development environment, InstallBuilder is
usually part of your build environment ISM's make structure.<br>

<br>
The following steps would be used to build a complete product
from scratch. The final deliverable from this process will be
an InstallShield self-extracting package, on Windows, or a
relocatable package, RPM, on Linux.<br>

<br>

<ol>
<li>"make all" from the top of your project ISM. This ensures that all
of your targets are up-to-date.</li>

<li>"make rawidb" from the top of your project ISM. This does three
things: 

<ol>
<li>First, it empties out "collect.raw" in your <i>build</i>
directory.</li>

          <li>Second, it invokes "make collect" recursively. In each of your leaf directories, 
            the collect rule should invoke <a href= 
"ibCollect.html">ibCollect.pl</a>, causing it to add an entry to a "collect.raw" 
            file in your <i>build</i> directory.</li>

          <li>Third, it runs the verifyCollection target in your <i>build</i> directory. 
            This uses <a href="ibVerifyCollection.html"> ibVerifyCollection.pl</a> 
            to compare "collect.raw" file to "collect.master" file. (NOTE: "collect.raw" 
            corresponds to SGI's "IDB", "collect.master" to "idb", and "ibVerifyCollection.pl" 
            to "gendist". Also note that when you are using "versions", you will 
            probably have several "collect.raw" and "collect.master" pairs -- 
            one pair for files common to all versions and a pair for each version.)</li>
</ol>
</li>

      <li>"make images" from the top of your project ISM. This runs "make images" 
        in your <i>build</i> directory. This rule invokes <a href= 
"ibBuild.html">ibBuild.pl</a>, which uses your product specification ("spec") 
        and "collect.master" files to build a self extracting installer. See the 
        man page for <a href=
"ibBuild.html">ibBuild.pl</a> for more information.</li>
</ol>
</dd>

<p></p>

<dt><b>KNOWN LIMITATIONS</b></dt>

<p></p>

<dd>The following limitiations have been identified for the Windows
platform.<br>

<br>

<dd>
<ol>
<li>The InstallBuilder only really works for "development" images
because it does not yet provide: 

<ul>
<li>any correct way to install images into "Program Files".</li>

<li>any way to modify the registry for a given application.</li>

<li>any way to do custom installation customization.</li>

<li>any way to modify the user's PATH or other variables.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>The InstallBuilder does not let users decide how much of the
image they want to install. It's an all or nothing
proposition.</li>

<li>Installations do not run without the user's interaction.</li>

<li>Versioning, prereqs, replaces, etc. are not supported by
InstallBuilder.</li>

<li>There is no support for shared files being installed (such as
the C library DLL).</li>

<li>InstallBuilder uses the InstallShield which comes with an MSDEV
license. Thus InstallBuilder can only detect that the user needs to
uninstall a previous version of the image, it can't do the
uninstallation for the user.</li>
</ol>
</dd>

<p></p>

  <dd>The following limitiations have been identified for the Windows platform 
    being used in conjunction with the p4 tools from <a href="http://www.perforce.com" target="_top">Perforce</a>.<br>

<br>

<ol>
<li>p4 Source Control Limitation: Make sure the p4 client's root
path is short enough. We
recommend something like "c:/depot" or "d:/trees". If the path gets
too long, you'll see mysterious trouble using InstallBuilder. Some
of the InstallShield executables that InstallBuilder uses choke
when run from directories whose names are too long. (Notably,
"compile" will complain about bad arguments and return value
256).</li>
</ol>
