# mandefs - Common definitions and macros for building documentation
#
# This file is the front-end to the system dependent mandefs file.
# Include mandefs individually in each Makefile (or, if not using
# ismcommondefs, in your top level ismdefs file.)
#
# The build uses GNU make and a Bourne-compatible shell. All pathnames and
# directories should be specified in UNIX style using the '/' separator
# (drive letters can also be used).
#
# This file requires the PLATFORM environment variable to be set.
# By default, it is set to "linux". Valid settings are:
#
#     linux   - the Linux Platform
#     mac     - the Macintosh OS8/9 Platforms
#     powertv - the PowerTv Platform
#     win32   - the Windows 9x/NT/2000 Platforms
#
# This file will define the environment variable WZDEV_DIR, depending
# on which platform is specified. The default location on each respective
# platfrom is:
#
#     linux   - /usr/local/wizzer
#     mac     - /usr/local/wizzer
#     powertv - C:/wizzer
#     win32   - C:/wizzer
