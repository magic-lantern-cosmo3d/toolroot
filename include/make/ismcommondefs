# ismcommondefs - Common build definitions and macros for ISMs
#                 (Note: includes commondefs!)
#
# This file is the front-end to the system dependent ismcommondefs file.
# This file contains definitions that should be common to all
# Makefiles for a particular ISM.  This file automatically includes
# 'commondefs' as well.  The ismcommondefs file adds definitions that
# require an ISM-like structure to exist (e.g. ISM_DEPTH must be
# defined for each Makefile).  Include ismcommondefs either in your
# top level ismdefs file or individually in each Makefile.
#
# Note: to use this file, the following variables MUST be
# defined before this file is (eventually) included:
#
#       PLATFORM
#	WZDEV_DIR
#	ISM_DEPTH
#	ISM_NAME
#	ISM_VERSION
#	ISM_TIMEBOMB_DATE
#
# The build uses GNU make and a Bourne-compatible shell. All pathnames and
# directories should be specified in UNIX style using the '/' separator
# (drive letters can also be used).
