#
# mandefs - Common build definitions and macros for man documentation
#
# This file is modeled after the mandefs file used for SGI IRIX builds.
# Include mandefs individually in each Makefile (or, if not using
# ismcommondefs, in your top level ismdefs file.)
#
# The build uses GNU make and a Bourne-compatible shell. All pathnames and
# directories should be specified in UNIX style using the '/' separator
# (drive letters can also be used).
#
# To build software on Linux you must install the Wizzer Works Toolroot.
# Assuming the toolroot is installed in the default location /usr/local/wizzer,
# you must put /usr/local/wizzer/InstallBuilder/bin in your PATH.
#
# The standard pathname for this file is:
#
#		/usr/local/wizzer/include/make/linux/mandefs
#
# If the Wizzer Works Toolroot has been installed in a location other than
# /usr/local/wizzer, define the environment variable WZDEV_DIR with the new
# location.
